So as a data analyst, I decided to do some analysis…While analyzing MTN customer churn dataset (Q1 2025) created by Oluwademilade Adeniyi based on Official MTN Nigeria product and pricing data from the MTN eShop Using Python & Power BI, I discovered I wasn’t the only one feeling this way and also over ₦23 million has been lost due to customers leaving the network just in Q1. That is a massive revenue leakage which I believe could have been avoided.
